# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio project, currently in its early stages of development. The main functionality implemented so far is the navigation bar. Although there are some flaws in it, I plan to address them in future iterations of the project.


## Future Development

In the upcoming months, I plan to continue development on this project. Some of the planned improvements include:

- Fixing flaws of the search button
- Adding additional pages for sections such as About Me, Projects, and Contact
- Improving the overall design and layout
